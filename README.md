# Deno Example: Insurance Claims Processing

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to process a list of insurance claims using Deno. Given a set of claims and available insurers, our objective is to distribute paymentss for the claims.

## Quick start

### Installing Deno

For macOS users, install Deno using Homebrew:

```
brew install deno
```

For other platforms or more installation options, please refer to the [official Deno documentation](https://deno.land/manual@v1.36.0/getting_started/installation).

### Running the program

Execute your Deno script with:

For running the work done in the interview
```
deno run ./script_done_in_the_interview.ts
```
For running the continuation
```
deno run ./domain/code-insurance/v2/calculate-price.use-case.ts
deno run ./domain/code-insurance/v1/calculate-price.use-case.ts  
```

### Test

```
deno test 
```


### Why deno and not node?

I've never used it before. Wanted to try it.
